I'm sorry I'm throwing this up as quickly as I can. I plan to create an easier to use interface. In the meantime the following list should help you locate events you may want to attend. 

Name  | Date | City | State | Notes

[Georgia Tiny Home Festival](https://unitedtinyhouse.com/2021-georgia-tiny-house-festival/) | 2020-3-20 | Conyers | Georgia | This is less about a community and more about showing your rig off. However, this event has become such a social nexus that I'm including it here. I was peer-pressured into joining this specific event.
