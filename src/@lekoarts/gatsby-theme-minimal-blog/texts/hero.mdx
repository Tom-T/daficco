I'm often asked where I find a the events that I attend to socialize with other nomads. Previously there was no central source. As somebody who has greatly benefits from the amazing community at large I'm happy to compile a list.

I've started to compile a source of events for others. While this is currently a work in progress, and a better user experience will follow I thought it would be better to provide something now. 

Please contact me using any of the methods on the top right of this page if you have any suggestions/reports/etc. 

I'd appreciate if you would share this resource to your friends. I also welcome constructive feedback as I work to improve this service.
